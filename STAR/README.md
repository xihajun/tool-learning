# STAR
As a beginner in biological world, I am trying to figure out how to use star in 21 Jan. Check out [this](https://bioinformatics-core-shared-training.github.io/cruk-summer-school-2019/Introduction/SS_DB/Materials/Practicals/Practical2_alignment_JK.html#transcriptome-alignment-with-star) which might be more reliable.

## Introduction
In my understanding, STAR is a software to map the rna-seq reads into a bigger genome. In order to do this, we will require us to install the software and some requirements. \[More info can be found [Readmore](./nihms722197.pdf)\]

Because I am too lazy, so I think I will need two things in order to this mapping. 
- [ ] Download the data (%TODO: sra usage). 
- [ ] Generate the genome indices to do the mapping (I am not 100% sure that I am fully understand this one)

__%TODO__ *As for the second thing, it is easy to follow the tutorial [here](./nihms722197.pdf). If you are too lazy to read those document like me, you can look at [this document](./Generate_genome.md) which will be created soon. And please remember to use all the cores if you have a lot.*

(21 Jan 15:26: don't know what will happen just waiting for data generating process)\n
(22 Jan, just found a link from summer school which is better than mine lol)
